// Question 127: Convert a traditional function expression to an arrow function.
// Explain & TIP: Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing function expressions.
//  They don't have their own bindings to this or super, and should not be used as methods.
// SOLUTION:
const traditionalFunction = function (a, b) {
    return a + b;
};
const arrowFunction = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(traditionalFunction(4, 9));
console.log(arrowFunction(4, 9));
export {};
