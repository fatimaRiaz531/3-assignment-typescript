// Question 136: Use console.log() to debug and track the value of a variable inside a loop.
// Explain & TIP: console.log() is an invaluable tool for developers to monitor the values of variables, the flow of execution, and to understand 
// the state of their program at various points in time, especially within loops where values change with each iteration.
// SOLUTION:
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    console.log(`Iteration ${i}, i value:, i`);
}
export {};
