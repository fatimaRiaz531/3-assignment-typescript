
// Question 107: Write a condition using logical operators that checks if a number is divisible by both 2 and 3.
// Explain & TIP: Checking for divisibility involves using the modulo operator (%) to see if there's any remainder.
//  A number divisible by both 2 and 3 without a remainder is also divisible by 6.

// SOLUTION:
// This function checks if a number is divisible by both 2 and 3
function isDivisibleByTwoAndThree(number:number): boolean {
    // Uses the modulo operator to check for no remainder

  return number %2 ===0 && number % 3 === 0; 
}
console.log(isDivisibleByTwoAndThree(12));
console.log(isDivisibleByTwoAndThree(14));
