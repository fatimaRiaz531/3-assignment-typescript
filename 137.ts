//   Question 137: Implement a try-catch block to handle potential errors in a block of code.
// Explain & TIP: The try-catch statement marks a block of statements to try, and specifies a response,
//  should an exception be thrown. It's a critical feature for robust error handling in JavaScript.

// SOLUTION:
try {
    throw new Error("Something went wrong");
} catch (error) {
    console.log(error.message);  
}
