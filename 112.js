// 🚀 Day 38 Challenge: Start Coding! 🚀
// Question 112: Create a Map that stores the names of countries as keys and their capitals as values. 
// Add three countries to the Map.
// Explain & TIP: The Map object in JavaScript holds key-value pairs and remembers the original insertion
//  order of the keys. It can be more efficient for large sets of data and when the key is not a string.
// SOLUTION:
const countries = new Map();
countries.set("USA", "Washington , D.C.");
countries.set("France", "Paris");
countries.set("Pakistan", "Peshawar");
console.log(countries);
export {};
